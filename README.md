# FindMyPremium
# This is a program that will approximate your life insurance/life annuity premium using the package openpyxl and the Illustrative Life Table published by the Society of Actuaries
# The complete Illustrative Life Table can be found at https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/Files/Edu/2018/ltam-standard-ultimate-life-table.pdf
# *Please note that this program does not take into account any other factors that may change the cost of life insurance. It goes purely off of the present value of the benefit, discounted at a rate of 5%.
