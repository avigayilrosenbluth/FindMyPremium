# FindMyPremium
# This is a program that will approximate your life insurance/life annuity premium using the package openpyxl and the Illustrative Life Table published by the Society of Actuaries
# The complete Illustrative Life Table can be found at https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/Files/Edu/2018/ltam-standard-ultimate-life-table.pdf
# This will calculate a 5-year annual premium using the Equivalence Principle (equating the APV of the benefits to the APV of the premium, with i = .05).
# *Please note that this program does not adjust for factors such as profit and expenses that may change the price of insurance.
